## Hi ðŸ‘‹

<br />My name is Thayller, I am a fullstack developer and passionate about science.
I love to learn, so I dedicate myself a lot to each one to learn more about Javascript and typescript and learn all their structures. In addition, I find it very important for software development that we learned about DevOps and unit tests.
